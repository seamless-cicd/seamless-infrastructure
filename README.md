# Seamless Infrastructure

Seamless's core AWS infrastructure. The major constructs in Seamless's infrastructure are described below.

## Resources Created

### VPC

A single non-default Virtual Private Cloud.

### EC2 Instance

An EC2 instance that hosts Seamless's backend Express server.

### Step Functions

An AWS-native state machine that coordinates the logic of Seamless's CI/CD pipeline.

### SNS Topic

An SNS topic for notifying our backend about pipeline status.

### RDS Instance

A Postgres database hosted on RDS storing all pipeline data.

### ElastiCache Redis Cluster

A Redis node hosted on ElastiCache for storing logs.

### ECS Cluster on EC2

An ECS cluster used for running pipeline tasks.

## Developer Information

To deploy the CDK:
- Create a `.env` environment variable containing the appropriate properties from `.env.example`
- If errors occur during deployment, do not prematurely quit the CDK. Allow the rollback to finish completely, fix the broken IaC, and redeploy.

To test the state machine for development:
- Locate the appropriate Step Function in the AWS console
- Pass input in the format specified in `state_machine_input.example.json`

### Useful commands

* `npm run build`   compile typescript to js
* `npm run watch`   watch for changes and compile
* `npm run test`    perform the jest unit tests
* `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
* `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
* `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
* `seamless deploy` will init `.env` file and deploy with aws cdk (package installed globally)

### Testing commands

* `node CLI/cli.js deploy`
  * This will be `seamless deploy` in production when infrastructure npm package is installed globally
  * This will create a `.env` file - with placeholder variables for now (will overwrite existing `.env` so save those variables if needed)
  * Will run aws `cdk deploy`
